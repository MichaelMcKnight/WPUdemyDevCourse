Wordpress Theme and Plugin Development Udemy Course
==========

This project is for personal growth.

I'm currently taking a Udemy course to increase my knowlege of theme development, and learn how to develop plugins for Wordpress. This is an in-depth course covering everything from theme development, plugin development, Gutenberg, WooCommerce and beyond!

While I'm already quite experienced in theme development, my hope for this course is to drastically increase my Wordpress knowledge to help me learn how to create unique soluitions for nearly any client.

The course is excellent! I highly recommend it for anyone developing for Wordpress. I can definitely see myself referencing many parts of this project in the future.

WARNING - Definitely not for beginners. I would suggest you have a couple of years experience before taking this course all the way through.
